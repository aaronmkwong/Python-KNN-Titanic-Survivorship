# Python-KNN-Titanic-Survivorship

This project uses K-Nearest Neighbours to  classify a passenger's survivorship as died or survived. It uses the same engineered data and features as the  **[Logistic Regression Titanic Survivorship](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-Logistic-Regression-Titanic-Survivorship)** project.
